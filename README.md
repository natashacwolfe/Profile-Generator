## What I accomplished

It was a rough start, but wrapping up this project felt great! I have a much better understanding of packages, node, promises, and so much more. Full disclosure I wasn't super excited to be moving into node, but now I glimps of it's power, and how it makes JavaScript so powerful, I am excited to learn more.
